# FAIR2Adapt 
Internal working repository for the [FAIR2Adapt project](https://eosc.eu/eu-project/fair2adapt/) which has a public [Github page](https://github.com/FAIR2Adapt).

## Case studies: 
1. Modeling the spread of radioactive isotopes in the arctic using [NorESM](https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm2/faq/postp_plotting_faq.html#different-sea-ice-and-ocean-grid) data from the Nansen environmental and remote sensing center ([NERSC](https://nersc.no/)).
2. Mitigation strategies for river-dominated ocean margins ([RiOMAR](https://fair2adapt.github.io/Hack4RiOMAR/)), e.g. for oyster farmers in France.
